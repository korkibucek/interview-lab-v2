# Linux Troubleshooting Lab â€“ Candidate Instructions

You are connected to a Linux server environment prepared with several faults.  
Your task is to diagnose and fix the issues so that the system is healthy and functioning as expected.  

You may use any Linux command-line tools installed on the system and install any other tools you need. You may also use AI assistants and Google.

## Objectives

Please complete the following:

1. **Web Service Accessibility**
   - A web service is installed but currently inaccessible from outside the server.  
   - Investigate why and restore it to working order.

2. **Broken Application Service**
   - There is a custom systemd service (`app.service`) that fails to start.  
   - Diagnose the reason and fix it so that it runs successfully.

3. **Excessive Logging**
   - One service is generating a very chatty log.  
   - Log rotation is configured but not functioning correctly.  
   - Correct the logrotate configuration so logs rotate and do not fill the disk.

4. **High CPU Usage**
   - The server is suffering from high CPU usage due to runaway processes.  
   - Identify the cause, stop the problem, and prevent it from recurring.

5. **Disk Pressure**
   - The root filesystem is under disk pressure from a large file.  
   - Investigate, decide on the correct action, and recover sufficient space.

## Constraints

- Do not reboot the server.
- Do not change SSH configuration (you must keep your own access intact).  
- Time limit of 30 minutes

## Deliverables

At the end of the exercise, please mention what you would do to prevent these issues in production.
