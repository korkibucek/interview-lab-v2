## Tip

This lab is designed to simulate **real-world troubleshooting**. Think in layers:
- Are services running?
- Are they listening on the right ports?
- Are they blocked by configuration or conflicts?
- Are logs, cron jobs, or misconfigurations causing resource problems?

Hints (read only if stuck):
- Use: ss -tulpen   -> see which process holds port 80.
- Use: systemctl status <service> and journalctl -u <service> for errors.
- If a service cannot write a file, check ownership/permissions of its target directory.
- Continuous log writers often need copytruncate or a restart on rotation.
- Cron jobs can spawn unexpected load; check /etc/cron.* and /etc/cron.d.
- Large files under /var/log can be safely removed if not in use (confirm with lsof).
